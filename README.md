# About the work

Textual  information  exchange,  by  typing  the information  and  send  it  to  the  other  end, is  one  of  the most prominent  mediums  of  communication  throughout  the  world. People   occupy a   lot   of   time   sending   emails  or additional information on  social  networking  sites where  typing  the whole information is redundant and time-consuming in this advanced era.  To  make  textual  information exchange  more  speedy  and easier, word predictive systems are launched which can predict the next most likely word so that people do not have to type the next word but select it from the suggested words. In this study, we  have  proposed  a  method  that  can  predict  the  next  most appropriate  and  suitable  word  in  Bangla  language, and  also  it can  suggest  the  corresponding  sentence  to  contribute  to  this technology    of    word    prediction    systems.    This    proposed approach  is,  using  GRU  (Gated  Recurrent  Unit)  based  RNN (Recurrent  Neural  Network)  on  n-gram  dataset  to  create  such language  models  that  can  predict  the  word(s)  from  the  input sequence  provided.  We  have  used  a  corpus  dataset,  collected from   different   sources   in   Bangla   language   to   run   the experiments.  Compared  to  the  other  methods  that  have been used  such as LSTM  (Long  Short  Term  Memory)  based  RNN on  n-gram  dataset  and Na√Øve  Bayes  with  Latent  Semantic Analysis, our  proposed  approach  gives  better  performance.  It gives   an   average accuracy   of   99.70%   for   5-gram   model, 99.24%   for   4-gram   model,   95.84%   for   Tri-gram   model, 78.15%, and  32.17%  respectively  for  Bi-gram  and  Uni-gram models on average 

Here one_gram to five_gram.ipnyb is the file I trained my model. model_deployment was the file where I deployed the model and get the expected output.
